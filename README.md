### This is a tool to export your student timetable from Rishum-Net system to iCalendar format, that can be imported to Google Calendar, Outlook, or whatever app you are using.

#### As this tool works with Rishum-Net, it is available for students of Faculty of Sciences only. Sorry.

#### <strong>Important!</strong> As you could notice, this site does not have SSL protection, so your login info will go to Rishum-Net server in plain text. You are warned.

#### <strong>Please note:</strong> current version is the first one. That means, it supports currently only 2014-2015 academic year, and has other limitations.
